I definitely don’t possess a IQ score of 203, but I do have tenacity and very conscientious, which I believe are the two most required traits adding to IQ for coding, I have had a lot of financial constraints in life, to an extent that I had to pause my university studies at some point and get any piece job I could find, this hasn’t stopped me from attaining my degree, I have since realized that there is a solution for everything most of the time we just have to find it. Furthermore, I recently came from a Business Finance internship and worked with a lot of spreadsheets and data in excel which heightened my analytical skills.
