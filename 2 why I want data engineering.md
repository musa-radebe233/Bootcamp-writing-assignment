I was trained in law and finance; to a certain extent finance is a soft skill and just like any other soft skill it overlaps to multiple domains of life, there are a few professions that produce a wholesome efficiency more than finance does. When an individual develops a good understanding of his finances they stand a good chance of managing their overall life outside of work. One learns how to effectively interpret and communicate data, manage time (patience) and most importantly hone the skill of discipline which inevitably increases your chances of attaining happiness – studies have shown that an overwhelming number of are unhappy because they feel that they are not in control of their lives. Much like finance Data Engineering although a hard skill syncs with your personal; data engineers design and build pipelines that transform and transport data into a format that is readily usable by end users; this requires you to have problem solving, analytical and attention to detail skills. 
Growing up I loved being a salesman, in high school and my community in general I sold anything I possibly could collaborating with a lot of much older people in my community. I learned about opportunity cost from selling snacks during break time years before I heard of the term, I diversified my portfolio by selling donuts in the morning and cool drink during lunch, hedging my business from risk. When I was in University I quickly picked finance as a major which brought me to a more sophisticated world and prompted me to open an account with a stock broker and my professional investment journey began. I believe learning Data Engineering is the missing stepping stone I need to propel me into success in my professional life as I want to eventually become a Financial Analyst, I have since picked up on a few skills in Finance that overlap to this field which will make life easier when doing this course, furthermore, I do believe the skills I will learn will ensure that I’m organized in my personal life also.
