My name is Nkosingiphile Radebe, I’m from a small town at the Northern part of KwaZulu-Natal named Glencoe. I was raised by parents who came from poverty stricken backgrounds; they taught me countless values and virtues of life, one of the values that came up from time to time was the respect for people, effectively communicating and cooperating with people is one of the crucial skills you have to learn to grasp the fruits of success especially when trapped in poverty. My family is anchored in Christian values and church was my life, this is the first place where I put my social skills to practice; when I was sixteen I got appointed as the youth leader which taught me a lot about working with people and conflict resolution. My love for people grew and by the time I was in Matric I was the prefect at my school, was part of the second team in rugby, sang in the school choir and was part a Rotary Club for public speaking. In University I studied Bcom Law majoring in Business Management and Finance; I met a lot of fantastic people and this fueled the love for finance, being in the financial world has taught me to be precise in my speech (being part of Toast Masters, a public speaking institution really helped) and more analytical; I recently got out of a two month Business Finance internship, we worked with spreadsheets and databases which prompted a lot of attention to detail skills and the ability to breakdown and simplify complicated problems. Outside the professional world I really love travelling and learning new languages which is weird to a lot of people I meet as Zulu’s are depicted as bigots and stubborn, currently I’m learning how to speak Tshivenda as I was recently in Musina visiting friends.
